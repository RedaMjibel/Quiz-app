  <li>Auth system/Session management</li>
  <li>Storage of quiz results under user accounts (This means you need to setup db storage for your application)</li>
  <li>Make application responsive</li>
  <li>Bonus: Design your code so that youâ€™re able to add new sets of quiz questions</li>
  <li>Bonus: Expose your quiz questions in the form of a REST API</li>
</ul>
  <h3>GO!</h3>

<p>Yes it&rsquo;s time to white-board, to code, to troubleshoot bugs, to re-code, to solve other bugs, to refactor, etc..</p>

<p>Development is not a long quiet river, but it can be really fun!</p>

<p>Starting today, you are building <strong>YOUR</strong> project - be proud of it!</p>

<h2>Evaluation - Show off!</h2>

<p>After the pitch, now you will code - nice right? but don&rsquo;t forget you will present it at the end (the Peer Learning Day following this project) in front of professionals and staff.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
